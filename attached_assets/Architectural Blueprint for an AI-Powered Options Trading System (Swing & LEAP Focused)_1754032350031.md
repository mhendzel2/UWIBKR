# **Architectural Blueprint for an AI-Powered Options Trading System (Swing & LEAP Focused)**

## **Part I: System Architecture and Foundational Principles**

This report outlines a professional-grade architectural blueprint for a sophisticated trading application. The design has been specifically adapted to focus on longer-term strategies such as **swing trading (holding positions for days to weeks) and LEAPs (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities with expirations over a year)**.33 It also incorporates a distinct, specialized module for intraday analysis of major indices using high-frequency market maker data. The architecture is founded on principles of modularity and event-driven design, ensuring that each component can operate independently and resiliently, forming a cohesive and powerful whole. A critical constraint addressed throughout this design is the limitation to

**outright purchasing of calls and puts only**, with no complex spreads or naked selling.

### **Section 1.1: A Professional-Grade Algorithmic Trading Architecture**

The foundation of this system is a robust **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**. An EDA is a software design pattern that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.1 In this context, an "event" can be a new piece of long-term options flow, a shift in market maker positioning on an index, or a signal generated by our analytical model. This approach decouples the system's components, allowing for greater resilience and maintainability, which is crucial for a system that will monitor positions over extended periods.1

The system will be conceptually divided into distinct layers, each with a single responsibility, communicating through an internal message queue.2

**The System's Conceptual Layers:**

* **Data Ingestion Layer:** This layer interfaces with the Unusual Whales API. It has two primary modes of operation:  
  1. **Swing/LEAP Data Polling:** It periodically polls for significant options flow, specifically filtering for longer-dated expirations suitable for swing trading and LEAPs.  
  2. **Periscope Index Stream:** For day trading major indices, it consumes a high-frequency (10-minute interval) data feed from the Periscope feature, which provides unique SPX market maker positioning data.35  
* **Processing & Signal Generation Layer:** This component consumes "raw data events." It leverages the high-performance Polars library to clean and structure the data. Its primary function is to apply rules to identify institutionally significant activity, such as large premium trades in long-dated options, and then publish a "processed data event."  
* **Intelligence Core:** This is the analytical brain of the system, centered around the Google Gemini Large Language Model (LLM). It consumes "processed data events" and performs a deeper analysis, synthesizing options flow and market structure to generate potential trade ideas (e.g., "Buy MSFT Jan 2026 Call" or "Buy SPX Weekly Put"). The output is a "trade hypothesis event."  
* **Risk & Validation Layer:** This is the most critical layer. It consumes "trade hypothesis events" and subjects them to a battery of automated checks. Given the constraint of only buying options, its primary focus is on **position sizing** and validating the logical soundness of the AI's suggestion. Only a fully validated hypothesis is passed along as a "confirmed trade idea event."  
* **Execution Gateway:** This layer is a dedicated service that encapsulates all interactions with the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) Trader Workstation (TWS) API. It manages the connection and handles the lifecycle of **single-leg option orders (buy-to-open)**. It consumes "confirmed trade idea events" only after explicit approval by the human user.  
* **User Interface (UI) / Control Panel:** The UI is the crucial point of human oversight. It presents "confirmed trade ideas" for final approval, displays current positions, and provides system status alerts.

This decoupled structure ensures that, for example, a slow API call in the Intelligence Core does not halt the ingestion of new Periscope data, maintaining system responsiveness.1

### **Section 1.2: Mastering Latency and Performance**

In algorithmic trading, latency—the delay between an event and the system's reaction—is a key metric. The requirements for this system are bifurcated:

1. **For Swing Trading & LEAPs:** Success is driven by the quality of the analytical signal, not millisecond speed. While the architecture is built for performance using tools like asyncio and Polars, the strategy itself is not latency-sensitive. The focus is on making a correct directional decision over a period of weeks or months.  
2. **For Periscope Index Day Trading:** Latency becomes more relevant. The Periscope data is updated every 10 minutes, providing a significant edge for intraday analysis of SPX.35 The system's asynchronous design ensures it can process this data and generate a hypothesis promptly, allowing the trader to act on timely information regarding market maker positioning.

The use of an asyncio event loop is crucial for the Periscope module. It allows the system to make a non-blocking call to the Gemini API for analysis while simultaneously being ready to ingest the next 10-minute data update. This prevents the data pipeline from getting clogged by its slowest component and ensures the system remains responsive during the trading day.

### **Section 1.3: The Bedrock: A Multi-Layered Risk Management Framework**

With the simplification to only buying calls and puts, the risk profile of each trade is clearly defined: the maximum possible loss is the premium paid for the option. The risk management framework is therefore re-oriented to focus intensely on **position sizing** and capital preservation.37

Pre-Trade Risk Controls:  
These are automated checks that run on every order before it is transmitted to the broker.

* **Parameter Sanity Checks:** The system will validate all parameters. Is the quantity positive? Is the expiration date in the future? Is the option type 'C' or 'P'?  
* **Position Sizing (The 1% Rule):** This is the cornerstone of the risk framework. The system will enforce a strict position sizing rule based on the "percent risk" method.38 Before placing any trade, the application will calculate the total premium required (  
  premium\_per\_contract \* quantity \* 100). This total cost will be compared against a user-defined percentage (e.g., 1%) of the total account equity. If the cost of the trade exceeds this threshold, the trade is blocked. This prevents any single trade from having an outsized negative impact on the portfolio.38  
  * Example Logic: trade\_cost \= premium \* quantity \* 100\. if trade\_cost \> (account\_equity \* 0.01): raise RiskViolationError("Trade exceeds max risk per trade.")  
* **Concurrency Prevention:** The system will implement a locking mechanism to prevent the accidental submission of the same trade multiple times due to rapid user clicks or a software glitch.

In-Flight Risk Controls:  
These are real-time monitoring processes that run continuously while the application is active.

* **Maximum Drawdown Limit:** The application will subscribe to real-time account P\&L updates from IBKR. It will maintain a running calculation of the day's net profit or loss. If this value drops below a pre-configured maximum drawdown threshold (e.g., a 5% loss on the starting day's equity), the system enters a "risk-off" state, preventing any new orders from being placed until manually reset by the user.3 This acts as a master circuit breaker.  
* **Connectivity Monitoring:** The system will have dedicated tasks that periodically send "heartbeat" requests to the Unusual Whales and IBKR APIs. If a connection is lost, the system will immediately enter the "risk-off" state, preventing it from trading blind based on stale data.

Model Risk Controls:  
This is a unique risk vector introduced by the use of an LLM. An LLM can "hallucinate" or provide factually incorrect information with high confidence.4 A dedicated validation layer for the AI's output is therefore essential. This will be detailed further in Section 3.3, but its place in the overall risk framework is established here. It includes checks for numerical accuracy, logical consistency, and cross-referencing with real market data before a trade idea is ever presented to the user for confirmation.6

## **Part II: The Data Engine: Ingestion and High-Performance Processing**

The data engine is tailored to serve two distinct trading horizons: long-term swing/LEAP positions and short-term index day trades. This requires a strategic approach to API endpoint selection and data processing.

### **Section 2.1: Taming the Firehose: Advanced Unusual Whales API Integration**

The Unusual Whales API provides the data necessary for both strategies. The key is to use the right endpoints with the right filters.8

**Strategic Endpoint Selection:**

| Endpoint | Primary Use Case | Update Frequency | Key Data Points | Notes/Caveats |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| /option-trades/flow-alerts | Identifying significant "whale" trades for **Swing & LEAP ideas**. | Real-time (poll) | total\_premium, total\_size, open\_interest, dte, ask\_side\_percentage | This is the primary trigger for long-term trade analysis. The key is to programmatically filter this endpoint for long dte values. 40 |
| **Periscope Feature Data** | Real-time GEX, DEX, Vanna, Charm for **SPX day trading**. | 10-minute intervals | Net Market Maker gamma, delta, etc., by strike. | This is a premium, specialized dataset for SPX only, revealing actual market maker net positioning. It forms the basis of the intraday trading module. 35 |
| /stock/:ticker/greeks | Daily snapshot of Greeks based on Open Interest. | Daily | gex, dex, etc. for the whole ticker. | Provides a baseline macro view of market maker positioning, useful for establishing the overall gamma regime for a swing trade. 7 |
| /stock/:ticker/stock-state | Last stock price and volume. | Real-time | price, volume | Essential context needed for providing the AI with the most current state of the underlying asset. 8 |

Data Acquisition Loop:  
The Data Ingestion Layer will run a persistent asyncio loop. This loop will poll the /option-trades/flow-alerts endpoint with filters appropriate for long-term trades and separately consume the Periscope data for SPX. It must incorporate robust error handling and rate limit management by inspecting the x-uw-req-per-minute-remaining header on API responses.9

### **Section 2.2: High-Performance Data Manipulation with Polars**

Once raw data is ingested, it must be rapidly processed using the Polars library. Its performance, stemming from a multi-threaded Rust core, is a critical advantage.10

Schema Enforcement and Data Type Conversion:  
The first step in Polars is to ingest JSON data into a DataFrame with a strict schema, explicitly casting columns to the correct data types (e.g., pl.Float64 for premium, pl.Datetime for timestamps) using the .cast() method.13  
Feature Engineering for Swing Trading and LEAPs:  
The goal is to create new, insightful features that provide richer context for the AI model. The following conceptual Polars pipeline demonstrates how to identify high-conviction, long-term institutional flow:

Python

import polars as pl  
from datetime import datetime

\# Assume 'raw\_flow\_df' is a Polars DataFrame from the /option-trades/flow-alerts API.

\# A single, chained expression for filtering and feature engineering  
long\_term\_conviction\_flow \= (  
    raw\_flow\_df  
    \# 1\. Filtering for high-conviction, long-term signals  
  .filter(  
        (pl.col("total\_premium") \>= 500\_000) &  \# Rule 1: Significant monetary value  
        (pl.col("total\_size") \> pl.col("open\_interest")) &  \# Rule 2: Likely an opening trade \[15, 16\]  
        (pl.col("ask\_side\_percentage") \> 0.80) & \# Rule 3: Strong buying aggression \[17, 18\]  
        (pl.col("dte") \>= 45) \# Rule 4: Focus on swing (45+ days) and LEAP (365+ days) timeframes  
    )  
    \# 2\. Engineering new features for richer context  
  .with\_columns(  
        \# Feature: Moneyness, indicates how far OTM/ITM the bet is  
        ((pl.col("strike") / pl.col("underlying\_price")) \- 1).alias("moneyness\_perc"),  
          
        \# Feature: Categorize trade horizon based on DTE  
        pl.when(pl.col("dte") \> 365)  
        .then(pl.lit("LEAP"))  
        .otherwise(pl.lit("Swing"))  
        .alias("trade\_horizon")  
    )  
    \# 3\. Sorting to prioritize the most significant trades  
  .sort("total\_premium", descending=True)  
)

\# This 'long\_term\_conviction\_flow' DataFrame is now ready for Gemini analysis.

This pipeline specifically filters for trades with a dte of at least 45 days, immediately separating them from short-term noise. It then engineers a trade\_horizon feature, explicitly telling the AI whether the signal is a candidate for a multi-month swing trade or a multi-year LEAP position. This pre-digestion of information makes the AI's task easier and its analysis more potent.

## **Part III: The Intelligence Core: Signal Generation and Validation**

This part of the architecture transforms the processed data into actionable intelligence. It translates market concepts into system logic and orchestrates the Google Gemini LLM to generate and validate trade hypotheses based on the new strategic focus.

### **Section 3.1: From Raw Data to Actionable Insight: Decoding Flow and Gamma**

The system must have a clear, code-defined understanding of the signals it is looking for, adapted for a longer time horizon.

Defining a "Whale Trade" Signal for Swing/LEAP Trading:  
A primary bullish signal is triggered when a call option trade meets a confluence of criteria indicating an aggressive, institutional opening purchase with a long-term outlook:

1. **Large Premium:** The total\_premium is substantial (e.g., \> $500,000), signifying a meaningful capital commitment.19  
2. **Opening Position:** The total\_size is significantly greater than the pre-existing open\_interest.15  
3. **Aggressive Execution:** The trade occurs predominantly at or near the ask price, signaling urgency.17  
4. **Sufficient Time Horizon:** The dte is long enough for a swing trade (e.g., \> 45 days) or qualifies as a LEAP (e.g., \> 365 days). This is the most important filter for this strategy.

Interpreting Gamma Exposure (GEX) for Swing Trading:  
While GEX is often used for short-term analysis, the overall GEX regime provides crucial context for swing trades.22

* **Positive GEX Regime:** When net gamma is positive, market makers' hedging tends to suppress volatility and promote range-bound action.24 This environment might suggest a lower probability of a strong, sustained breakout, informing the thesis for a swing trade.  
* **Negative GEX Regime:** When net gamma is negative, hedging activity amplifies price moves and increases volatility.24 A swing trade initiated in this regime has a higher probability of experiencing a powerful, directional move. The AI will be instructed to consider the GEX regime as a key contextual factor for its long-term outlook.

Using Periscope for Intraday Index Trading:  
The Periscope module operates separately. It analyzes the high-frequency SPX data to identify intraday shifts in market maker positioning. A sudden build-up of negative gamma at a specific strike, for example, could signal a potential for accelerating price moves if that level is breached, providing a clear, actionable thesis for a short-term day trade on the index.35

### **Section 3.2: Engineering Prompts for Gemini: From "Vibe Coding" to Precision Analysis**

The prompt for Gemini must be re-engineered to reflect the new strategies and constraints. It will demand a structured, programmatically parsable JSON output.26

1. **Persona:** "You are an expert options strategist specializing in identifying long-term opportunities for swing trading and LEAPs based on institutional options flow. You are also capable of analyzing high-frequency market maker positioning for short-term index trades. Your recommendations must be limited to buying single-leg calls and puts." 27  
2. **Context:** "You are analyzing data to generate high-probability trade ideas. The primary objective is capital appreciation through multi-week or multi-month directional plays. All trade suggestions must be simple long calls or long puts. No spreads or selling of options is permitted."  
3. **Data Input:** The prompt will include the prepared Polars DataFrames converted to a string format.  
4. **Task & Instructions:** "Analyze the provided data. First, provide a concise 'Market Vibe' summary. Second, identify the top 1 to 3 potential trading opportunities. For each opportunity, provide your detailed reasoning, linking specific data points to your conclusion. Suggest a specific long call or long put that aligns with your analysis."  
5. **Output Format Specification:** "Your final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object. The JSON object must adhere to the following schema: {\\"analysis\_summary\\": \\"\<Your summary\>\\", \\"trade\_ideas\\":}"

This strict JSON output allows the application to reliably parse the AI's response into a Python dictionary, making the LLM a predictable component in the automated workflow.

### **Section 3.3: Validating the Oracle: Mitigating LLM Risk in a Financial Context**

An LLM is a probabilistic model and can make errors.4 A rigorous, automated validation layer must scrutinize every response from Gemini.

The validation pipeline will consist of a series of checks:

1. **JSON Schema and Syntax Validation:** The first step is to ensure the response is a valid JSON object that conforms to the predefined schema.  
2. **Numerical Sanity Checks:** Are all strike prices and quantities positive numerical values? Are the expiration dates valid and in the future?  
3. **Market Data Cross-Reference:** The system will make a secondary API call to IBKR to verify that the suggested option contract (ticker, strike, expiration, type) actually exists and is tradable. This protects against hallucinations.  
4. **Logical Consistency Check:** Does the strategy\_type ("Long Call" or "Long Put") match the sentiment expressed in the reasoning? A bullish reasoning must be paired with a Long Call suggestion.  
5. **User Risk Parameter Check:** The final check ensures the suggested trade conforms to the user's global risk settings, such as allowed tickers or maximum DTE.

Only a trade idea that passes every stage of this validation pipeline is forwarded to the user's control panel for final review.

## **Part IV: The Execution Gateway: From Signal to Live Order**

This layer is dramatically simplified due to the constraint of only buying single-leg options. It translates a validated, user-confirmed trade idea into a correctly formatted order and transmits it to the market via the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) TWS API.

### **Section 4.1: Mastering the Interactive Brokers TWS API for Single-Leg Options**

The Execution Gateway service will encapsulate all complexity of the IBKR TWS API, which is a TCP socket-based protocol.28 It will manage the connection and message stream via a class that inherits from

EClient and EWrapper.29 The TWS or IB Gateway application must be configured with "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients" checked and "Read-Only API" unchecked.28

Constructing Single-Leg Option Contracts:  
Unlike spreads, which require complex "BAG" orders, single-leg options are straightforward to define.30 The Execution Gateway will contain a simple helper function to create the necessary  
Contract object.

Python

from ibapi.contract import Contract

def create\_option\_contract(symbol: str, expiry: str, strike: float, right: str) \-\> Contract:  
    """Creates an IBKR Contract object for a single-leg option."""  
    contract \= Contract()  
    contract.symbol \= symbol  
    contract.secType \= "OPT"  
    contract.exchange \= "SMART"  \# Use SMART routing  
    contract.currency \= "USD"  
    contract.lastTradeDateOrContractMonth \= expiry  \# Format "YYYYMMDD"  
    contract.strike \= strike  
    contract.right \= right  \# "C" for Call, "P" for Put  
    contract.multiplier \= "100"  
    return contract

This function abstracts the details of contract creation, turning it into a simple, reusable call.43

### **Section 4.2: The Full Execution Workflow**

The end-to-end workflow begins when the user confirms a trade and ends with the position being actively monitored.

From User Confirmation to Live Order:  
Once the user clicks "Confirm Trade" in the UI, the following sequence is initiated:

1. **Contract Creation:** The system calls the create\_option\_contract helper function with the parameters from the validated trade idea.  
2. **Order Creation:** An Order object is created.31  
   * action: This will always be 'BUY'.  
   * orderType: This will typically be 'LMT' (Limit Order) to control the execution price, representing the maximum premium the trader is willing to pay.  
   * totalQuantity: The number of contracts to trade, determined by the risk management layer.  
   * lmtPrice: The net premium for the option.  
   * transmit: This must be set to True to send the order to the exchange.30  
3. **Order Placement:** The system calls self.placeOrder(self.nextOrderId, contract, order), using the next available order ID.31

Order and Position Monitoring:  
The Execution Gateway will implement the necessary EWrapper callback methods to handle messages from TWS:

* orderStatus: This callback is invoked whenever the status of an order changes (e.g., Submitted, Filled, Cancelled), allowing for real-time UI updates.31  
* execDetails: When an order is filled, this provides the definitive confirmation of the trade.31  
* updatePortfolio and updateAccountValue: The system will subscribe to account updates by calling reqAccountUpdates. These callbacks provide real-time information on all positions and key account metrics like NetLiquidation, which is essential for the position sizing and max drawdown risk calculations.29

## **Part V: Conclusion and Path Forward**

This report has laid out a revised architectural blueprint for an AI-driven options trading application, specifically tailored for a strategy focused on **swing trading and LEAPs via the outright purchase of calls and puts**. The design is distinguished by its dual-horizon data analysis—long-term for swing/LEAP identification and high-frequency for intraday index trading via the Periscope feature.

The architecture's core strengths remain in its event-driven, modular design and its use of high-performance tools. However, the strategic pivot has led to crucial modifications. The execution logic has been greatly simplified, removing the complexity of multi-leg spread orders and focusing entirely on single-leg execution. Most importantly, the **risk management framework has been re-centered around a rigorous position sizing methodology** (the "1% rule"), which is the most critical safeguard when buying options. The AI's role has been re-scoped through prompt engineering to align with these new strategic goals and constraints, and the validation layer ensures its outputs are safe and logical within this new context.

Path to Production:  
A disciplined, phased approach to deployment is critical.

1. **Backtesting:** The core signal generation logic must be rigorously tested against historical data. The Unusual Whales API provides access to historical flow data, which can be used to simulate the data ingestion process and evaluate the historical performance of the swing/LEAP identification strategy.7  
2. **Paper Trading:** The complete, end-to-end system must be deployed and connected to an Interactive Brokers paper trading account.32 This phase is essential for identifying and resolving bugs in the execution logic, connection management, and real-time data handling in a live market without financial risk.  
3. **Incremental Live Deployment:** After successful paper trading, the system can be deployed with a small, controlled allocation of real capital. The position sizing should be set to its most conservative level (e.g., 0.5% of account equity). As the system demonstrates consistent and reliable performance, the capital allocation can be gradually and cautiously increased.

By adhering to this revised blueprint and following a disciplined path to production, it is possible to construct a trading application that is not only powerful and intelligent but is also precisely aligned with the specified trading style and risk constraints.
